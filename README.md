dimwit
======

Dynamic Image Manipulation Service with Nginx


Features
=========
Uses the [HttpImageFilterModule](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_image_filter_module.html) to dynamically process remote images into cropped, rotated and resized derivatives based on remote source images.
Derivative images are created only once per unique url and stored locally.  Duplicate requests are served directly from disk.

Setup (using Docker Alpine)
=====

Just run the docker container ondra42/dimwit with Port 80:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ondrejp/dimwit
```

Setup (using Ubuntu)
=======
1.  Launch a server, e.g. *Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS*.  Nothing special except you need ports 22 (to login via ssh) and 8080 to run the service.

2. SSH into the machine and run the following commands:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install nginx-extras-dbg
# if you get an error uncomment the offending lines in this file and try to reinstall nginx again
# sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list

git clone https://github.com/OndrejP/dimwit
sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.preDimwit
sudo cp dimwit/*.conf /etc/nginx/
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```
*That's it!*
