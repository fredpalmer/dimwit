Dynamic Image Manipulation Service with Nginx


Features
=========
Uses the [HttpImageFilterModule](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpImageFilterModule) to dynamically process remote images into cropped, rotated and resized derivatives based on remote source images.
Derivative images are created only once per unique url and stored locally.  Duplicate requests are served directly from disk.


Setup (using Ubuntu)
=======
1.  Launch a server, e.g. *Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 LTS*

Nothing special except you need ports 22 (to login via ssh) and 8080 to run the service.

``` bash
# When you log into the server from the terminal run these commands
mkdir /mnt/media/   # Or whatever you want the server root to be
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /mnt/media
chmod 777 /mnt/media

sudo apt-get install nginx-extras-dbg
# if you get an error uncomment the offending lines in this file and try to reinstall nginx again
# sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list

curl -O https://raw.github.com/fredpalmer/dimwit/develop/nginx.conf
sudo mv nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

You should be running now.
